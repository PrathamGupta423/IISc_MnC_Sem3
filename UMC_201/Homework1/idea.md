## Goal is to implement a way to process large numbers in c++ without using any libraries.

### Requirements:
- The program should be able to handle numbers of any size.
- The program should be able to handle both positive and negative numbers.
- We should be able to sort a list of numbers.
- We should be able to add, subtract and compare numbers.

### Approach:
- We will store the numbers as strings. 
- We will implement functions to add, subtract and compare numbers.
- We will implement a function to sort a list of numbers. Utilizing standard library sort function.

### Debugging and Testing:
- We will implement a print function to print the numbers.
- We will test the functions with different test cases.
- in later stages we will call the function from python to test the performance.

### Implementation:
- We will implement the functions in a class.
- We will implement the functions in a header file and include it in the main file.
- Class will have a constructor to initialize the number.
- Class will have functions to add, subtract, compare and sort numbers.
- We will implement a print function to print the numbers.
- Class stores the number as a string and a boolean to store the sign of the number.
