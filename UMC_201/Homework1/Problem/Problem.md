Your starting point for this Homework is a Python program that processes ultra-large integers. (Note that in Python, the int datatype supports ultra-large integers.)

# Your task: Make the given Python program faster by:
- (Optional) Optimizing the Python algorithm.
- (Required) Rewriting parts of the Python implementation in C/C++, including a C/C++ data structure for ultra-large integer calculations.

# Given files:
- hw1.py: Do not modify this file.
- count_pairs.py: Modify this file so that the hw1.py program runs faster.
- A sample input file (inputs.txt)

# What you should submit: A single .zip file containing
- The modified count_pairs.py file that calls your C/C++ code appropriately.
- A C/C++ header file (the ADT for your ultra-large integers)
- A C/C++ code file (an implementation of your ADT)
- A Makefile to compile your C/C++ code
